## Expert Knowledge Worker: A Question Answering Agent
Welcome to the Expert Knowledge Worker project! This repository contains the code for developing a question-answering agent designed for Insurellm, an Insurance Tech company as an example. The agent is intended to assist employees by providing accurate answers to a wide range of questions, ensuring high-quality responses with a focus on low-cost implementation.

## Key Features:
1. Accuracy: Built to provide reliable and precise answers to insurance-related questions.
2. Low-Cost Solution: The solution is designed to be cost-effective, minimizing infrastructure and operational overhead.
3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Leverages a simple, brute-force implementation of RAG to improve the accuracy of responses by combining information retrieval with natural language generation.


## Technologies Used:
1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A method that enhances the question-answering capabilities by retrieving relevant information and generating accurate answers.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Core technology used to understand and process user queries.
3. Future Enhancements:
4. Advanced RAG Techniques: Future versions will incorporate more sophisticated RAG methods to improve performance and scalability.
5. Continuous Learning: Incorporating a feedback loop for continuous improvement based on user input.
